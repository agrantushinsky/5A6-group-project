# Fresh Tomatoes

## Goal
Our goal is to provide users a dynamic appilcation to review movies they have watched. The FreshTomatoes app also features advanced review filtering, and sorting options. Moreover, users may search, browse suggested movies, or browse by genre to find the movie they're looking for.

## Technologies
- Kotlin 
- Jetpack Compose
- Firebase
- Material
- Ktor
- TMDB API

## Quick-start
### How to install and run appilcation.
1. Download project from github.
2. Open in IDE (Android Studio) 
3. Press the run button and enjoy!

> [!NOTE]  
> Your device must be capable of running Android API 34.

### Deployment 
Since the app is still a working progress we have not deployed it yet on the app store.
